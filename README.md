# 🌍 Environmental Monitoring System (EMS)

The **Environmental Monitoring System** is a C#-based project designed to 
simulate the collection, processing, and evaluation of environmental sensor 
data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality. The main objective of this 
project is to **implement and perform comprehensive unit testing** to ensure 
that the system behaves reliably and correctly under various conditions.

---

## 🎯 Project Aim

The core purpose of this project is to **test how well the system behaves** 
using unit testing techniques. It focuses on:
- Ensuring the accuracy of sensor data processing
- Validating alert triggers when environmental thresholds are exceeded
- Verifying proper data storage and retrieval logic
- Testing edge cases such as invalid data, sensor failure, or extreme 
environmental readings

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **.NET 6.0 / .NET Core**
- **C#**
- **xUnit** (for unit testing)
- **Entity Framework Core** (if database simulation is included)
- **Moq** (for mocking dependencies in tests)
- **In-memory data stores** (for test isolation)

---
